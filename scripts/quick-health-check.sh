# Quick diagnostic to check Traefik, container health and the music-library freeze harness.
#
# ⚠️  EXIT-CODE BEHAVIOUR CHANGED 2026-08-18 (plan 01-09, D-29).
#     This script used to ALWAYS exit 0 — it printed ❌ for a down Traefik and carried on with no
#     other consequence. It now exits 1 when the music freeze harness fails or cannot be reached.
#     Stated here because other things may call this script and a silent-to-failing change is
#     exactly the kind of thing that should be visible in the file, not only in a plan.
#
#     Why: a check that is easy to ignore is a check that does not fire. The docker `created`-state
#     blind spot left dispatcharr and teleport down for six weeks while the estate reported clean.
#     The Traefik/Authelia blocks above are deliberately left as-is; only the harness is fatal,
#     because it is the only block here with a maintained assertion contract
#     (scripts/check-music-freeze.sh exits non-zero on any failed assertion).
#
#     The harness's two library mode counts are REPORTED, not asserted, so this script does not
#     inherit a permanent red — see MODE SCOPE in scripts/check-music-freeze.sh.
#
# ⚠️  A SECOND FATAL BLOCK WAS ADDED 2026-09-01 (plan 02-09, D-41).
#     scripts/check-music-consumers.sh now also runs here, and it too exits this script 1 on a
#     failed assertion or on an unreachable host. Stated in the file for the same reason as
#     above: a silent addition to what can fail a shared health check is exactly the kind of
#     thing that should be visible here and not only in a plan.
#
#     What it covers: CONS-01 (the ro NFS export of /mnt/tank/media/Music from atlantis to the
#     HA NUC), CONS-02 (three pinned proof albums exact-matched in Music Assistant on album name
#     AND album artist, attributed to the local filesystem provider) and CONS-03 (mount liveness).
#     It also reports the same three albums in Jellyfin.
#
#     Why it is load-bearing rather than nice-to-have: the Music Assistant add-on is on
#     auto_update (D-56), and MA is pinned to a BETA (2.11.0b0 at the time of writing). A release
#     that changes provider behaviour — the album-artist fallback, the provider filter, the API
#     shape — would otherwise land silently and the library would go wrong with nothing saying
#     so. This block IS the drift detector: the audit records the MA version every assertion was
#     proven at, so a behaviour change surfaces as a failed assertion rather than a silent pass.
#
#     Both its scope=temp-export rows and its Jellyfin out-of-scope rows are REPORTED, not
#     asserted, so this script does not inherit a permanent red from a torn-down control either.

EXIT_CODE=0

# WR-10: ONE REACHABILITY PROBE, GATING THE WHOLE FILE.
#
# Everything below reads container state over ssh from 172.16.1.159. The five legacy blocks
# degrade badly when that host is down, and they do it in the two worst ways at once:
#
#   * UNHEALTHY=$(ssh ... | wc -l) comes back EMPTY, `[ "" -gt 0 ]` writes "integer expression
#     expected" to stderr and returns 2, and the else branch prints "✅ No unhealthy containers".
#   * the Traefik and Authelia blocks read ssh's exit 255 as "the container is not running" and
#     print "❌ Not running" - a confident and WRONG diagnosis rather than UNKNOWN.
#
# That directly contradicts the doctrine stated 60 lines further down in this same file ("Absence
# of a failure signal is NOT evidence of health"), which the two music blocks do honour. Before
# this gate, an LXC 100 outage produced a transcript reading "❌ Not running / ❌ Not running /
# Containers running: <blank> / ✅ No unhealthy containers" - the exit code saved it, the
# transcript above it was misinformation.
#
# Probing once and refusing is better than hardening five call sites: it makes the unreachable
# case a single, unmissable statement instead of five separately-wrong lines.
