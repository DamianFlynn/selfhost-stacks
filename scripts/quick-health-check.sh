# Quick diagnostic to check Traefik, container health and the music-library freeze harness.
#
# ⚠️  EXIT-CODE BEHAVIOUR CHANGED 2026-08-18 (plan 01-09, D-29).
#     This script used to ALWAYS exit 0 — it printed ❌ for a down Traefik and carried on with no
#     other consequence. It now exits 1 when the music freeze harness fails or cannot be reached.
#     Stated here because other things may call this script and a silent-to-failing change is
#     exactly the kind of thing that should be visible in the file, not only in a plan.
#
#     Why: a check that is easy to ignore is a check that does not fire. The docker `created`-state
#     blind spot left dispatcharr and teleport down for six weeks while the estate reported clean.
#     The Traefik/Authelia blocks above are deliberately left as-is; only the harness is fatal,
#     because it is the only block here with a maintained assertion contract
#     (scripts/check-music-freeze.sh exits non-zero on any failed assertion).
#
#     The harness's two library mode counts are REPORTED, not asserted, so this script does not
#     inherit a permanent red — see MODE SCOPE in scripts/check-music-freeze.sh.
#
# ⚠️  EXIT-CODE BEHAVIOUR CHANGED AGAIN — A SECOND FATAL BLOCK WAS ADDED 2026-09-01 (plan 02-09,
#     D-41).
#     (Retitled 2026-09-03 by plan 02.1-10. Only the first six words are new: this notice was
#     written as "A SECOND FATAL BLOCK WAS ADDED" and did not carry the shared phrase, so
#     `grep -c 'EXIT-CODE BEHAVIOUR CHANGED'` returned 1 while the file held two such notices.
#     The convention is now greppable, which is the only reason to name a thing consistently.)
#     scripts/check-music-consumers.sh now also runs here, and it too exits this script 1 on a
#     failed assertion or on an unreachable host. Stated in the file for the same reason as
#     above: a silent addition to what can fail a shared health check is exactly the kind of
#     thing that should be visible here and not only in a plan.
#
#     What it covers: CONS-01 (the ro NFS export of /mnt/tank/media/Music from atlantis to the
#     HA NUC), CONS-02 (three pinned proof albums exact-matched in Music Assistant on album name
#     AND album artist, attributed to the local filesystem provider) and CONS-03 (mount liveness).
#     It also reports the same three albums in Jellyfin.
#
#     Why it is load-bearing rather than nice-to-have: the Music Assistant add-on is on
#     auto_update (D-56), and MA is pinned to a BETA (2.11.0b0 at the time of writing). A release
#     that changes provider behaviour — the album-artist fallback, the provider filter, the API
#     shape — would otherwise land silently and the library would go wrong with nothing saying
#     so. This block IS the drift detector: the audit records the MA version every assertion was
#     proven at, so a behaviour change surfaces as a failed assertion rather than a silent pass.
#
#     Both its scope=temp-export rows and its Jellyfin out-of-scope rows are REPORTED, not
#     asserted, so this script does not inherit a permanent red from a torn-down control either.
#
# ⚠️  EXIT-CODE BEHAVIOUR CHANGED AGAIN — A THIRD FATAL BLOCK WAS ADDED 2026-09-03 (phase 02.1,
#     plan 02.1-10, D-20).
#     scripts/check-jellyfin-transcode.sh now also runs here, and it too exits this script 1.
#     Stated in the file for the same reason as the two notices above: a silent addition to what
#     can fail a shared health check is exactly the kind of thing that should be visible here and
#     not only in a plan.
#
#     (The plan set was written 2026-09-02 and its acceptance criterion names that date. Execution
#     crossed midnight UTC, so the true addition date is the 3rd and that is what is recorded —
#     the same UTC/local rollover that cost plan 02.1-06 a run when its proof client computed a
#     log filename by date arithmetic. A notice that states when it was added should state when it
#     was actually added.)
#
#     WHAT MAKES IT EXIT 1 — six conditions, and five of them are "could not look":
#       - a failed assertion in the check itself
#       - LXC 100 (172.16.1.159) unreachable            [caught by the probe at lines 60-69]
#       - atlantis (172.16.1.158) unreachable, so the authoritative zfs quota and mounted
#         readings cannot be taken
#       - the Jellyfin container absent or docker unavailable
#       - the credential file at /mnt/fast/secrets/jellyfin-deercrest.env absent, or not 600 root
#       - fast/transcode UNMOUNTED. This one is the least obvious and the most dangerous: if the
#         dataset is not mounted, /mnt/fast/transcode is a PLAIN DIRECTORY on the parent, the bind
#         still works, the container still writes — and the 50 G quota applies to none of it,
#         while `zfs get quota` from atlantis still returns 53687091200 and reads perfectly green.
#         An unmounted dataset is an unbounded transcode path that looks completely normal.
#
#     WHAT IT COVERS, by requirement id:
#       TRAN-01  the mount shape — /cache and /cache/transcodes are declared binds to /mnt/fast
#       TRAN-02  ZERO `Type: volume` mounts on the container. The INVARIANT, not one volume id:
#                a fresh anonymous volume with a different id is the same failure
#       TRAN-03  the 50 G ZFS quota on fast/transcode AND the dataset being mounted
#       TRAN-04  the five encoding values, plus the two amdgpu values (D-30)
#       TRAN-05  `/` headroom against a 20 GiB floor
#
#     WHICH OF ITS ROWS ARE REPORTED, NOT ASSERTED — so the reader knows it will not go
#     permanently red, which is the 01-09 trap and the reason the mode-bit assertions were
#     removed from check-music-freeze.sh:
#       - The seven encoding values are REPORTED. A standing check cannot start a transcode, so
#         it cannot prove a setting FIRES; it can only prove the value has not drifted. They are
#         a REGRESSION DETECTOR. The firing proofs were executed once, by plan 02.1-06, from
#         Jellyfin's own Debug log — do not let this read-back stand in for that (CONS-04).
#       - The `/` headroom floor is GREEN TODAY WITH MEASURED MARGIN, chosen that way
#         deliberately. At the phase head the margin was 185 MiB; after 02.1-06 deleted the
#         12.55 GiB anonymous volume and 02.1-09 reaped four images it is 14.48 GiB. A
#         permanently-red check trains the reader to ignore it, so a red here should be read as
#         real.
#       - Section 4's `df` reading of the transcode directory is REPORTED (corroboration only).
#
#     A JELLYFIN API BLIP IS NOT A BOUND VIOLATION. The encoding GET retries 3× at 2 s and, if
#     all three fail, is reported as `UNREACHABLE` in a counter kept SEPARATE from the failure
#     count. The script still exits non-zero — fail-closed is not negotiable (D-19) — but the
#     reader can tell "could not look" from "the value moved". A check that goes red for
#     transient reasons trains the reader to ignore it exactly as a permanently-red one does.
#
# ⚠️  KNOWN LIMIT, AND IT APPLIES TO THIS WHOLE FILE: THIS SCRIPT IS MANUAL. IT ONLY EVER FIRES
#     WHEN SOMEBODY TYPES IT (D-22, phase 02.1).
#     There is no cron entry, no systemd timer and no notification path. Nothing here will tell
#     you anything at 3am. If you are reading a green tick from this script, it is green because
#     you asked — not because anything has been watching.
#
#     That matters more than it sounds, because of what this file now covers. The incident phase
#     02.1 exists to fix was 19 GB accumulating in an anonymous Docker volume on / over roughly
#     36 hours, taking / to zero, with NOBODY LOOKING. The block above closes the "we had no way
#     to see it" half of that. It does not close the "nobody looked" half, and this notice exists
#     so a reader does not mistake the first for the second.
#
#     Scheduling and alerting are DELIBERATELY DEFERRED, not overlooked. Delivery, deduplication
#     and notification-channel choice are their own decisions with their own failure modes — and
#     the specific reason for the deferral is that PHASE 2 CLOSED WITH A MOUNT-FAILURE
#     NOTIFICATION THAT WAS NEVER PROVEN TO DELIVER. An unproven notification path is WORSE than
#     a known-manual check, because it feels covered. A known limit you can read is safer than an
#     assumed capability you cannot test.
#
#     So: run this after any change to Jellyfin, the fast/* datasets, the NFS export or the
#     Music library, and on any morning the estate feels odd. Recorded here rather than only in
#     a planning document because the person about to trust a green tick is the person who needs
#     to know it only ran because they typed it.

EXIT_CODE=0

# WR-10: ONE REACHABILITY PROBE, GATING THE WHOLE FILE.
#
# Everything below reads container state over ssh from 172.16.1.159. The five legacy blocks
# degrade badly when that host is down, and they do it in the two worst ways at once:
#
#   * UNHEALTHY=$(ssh ... | wc -l) comes back EMPTY, `[ "" -gt 0 ]` writes "integer expression
#     expected" to stderr and returns 2, and the else branch prints "✅ No unhealthy containers".
#   * the Traefik and Authelia blocks read ssh's exit 255 as "the container is not running" and
#     print "❌ Not running" - a confident and WRONG diagnosis rather than UNKNOWN.
#
# That directly contradicts the doctrine stated 60 lines further down in this same file ("Absence
# of a failure signal is NOT evidence of health"), which the two music blocks do honour. Before
# this gate, an LXC 100 outage produced a transcript reading "❌ Not running / ❌ Not running /
# Containers running: <blank> / ✅ No unhealthy containers" - the exit code saved it, the
# transcript above it was misinformation.
#
# Probing once and refusing is better than hardening five call sites: it makes the unreachable
# case a single, unmissable statement instead of five separately-wrong lines.
